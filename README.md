This is a self designed robot with four legs, each of which has 2 dof. The printed robot is shown in the [robot_info](https://github.com/zyx124/self_designed_quadruped_robot/blob/master/robot_info.pdf). The robot is controlled by a raspberry pi.

The motor used in the robot is LX-16A designed and produced by LewanSoul Company, which is an awesome product. Thanks to [Ethan's work](https://www.ethanlipson.com/lx16a-library/), we can control the motor easily. 

The robot now only has a very basic [gait pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-jvvnHUyv0) and is still underdeveloped. More work will be uploaded.
